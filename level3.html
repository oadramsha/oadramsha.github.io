            <h2>What is SQL Injection?</h2>
            <p>
                SQL injection is a type of web security vulnerability or commonly known as a code injection technique used primarily by hackers that might destroy your database. Attackers have access to view and manipulate sensitive data that they should not otherwise have access to.
            </p>
            <p>SQL injection attacks can cause unauthorized access, theft of data, and in severe cases, full system takeover, which is not favourable for the user.</p><br>

            <h3>How Does SQL Injection Work?</h3>
            <p>
              
                SQL injection attacks usually follow through by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's input validation process. An example can include an attackers malicious input in the form of a web or URL parameter. Here’s an 
                example of a vulnerable SQL query in a login system that a user may not catch initially: 
            </p>

            <div class="code-block">
                <code>


//vulnerable SQL query
<br>
const username = req.body.username;<br>
const password = req.body.password;<br>
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
//if the input is not properly sanitized, the following input could bypass authentication:
username: 'admin' -- 
password: ''  //this comment trick removes the password check
                </code>
            </div>

            <p>This code will allow the attacker to enter a malicious input, bypassing authentication by commenting out the password check as shown above.</p><br>

            <h3>Safe SQL Query Using Parameterized Statements</h3>
            <p>
                One way to prevent SQL injection is by using parameterized statements or prepared queries. Here’s an 
                example of a safer version of the same query above, only using parameterized input this time:
            </p>

            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>

//secure SQL query using parameters
const username = req.body.username;
const password = req.body.password;
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';
db.query(query, [username, password], (err, result) => {if (err) throw err;
});
/User inputs are passed as seperate parameters and are properly escaped
                </pre>
            </div>

            <p>
                This approach ensures that user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command, preventing 
                malicious inputs from being executed on your database without you knowing. Always practice safety in any workspace to ensure the safety and privacy of yourself and others!
